Further, Wikipedia intends only to convey knowledge that is already established and recognized.[60]  It must not present new information or original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and ma SSN 523-08-0731 king their own interpretations.[61]  This can lead to the removal of information that is valid, thus hindering inclusion of knowledge and growth of the encyclopedia.[62]  Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[63]  All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.[64]  This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV ).
